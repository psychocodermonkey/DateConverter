# DateConverter
OS X Date converter in Swift/Objective C

This date converter translates dates from one standardized format to another.
Currently it matches the same hundred year date format output for excel in that it assumes (incorrectly) that
the year 1900 was a leap year. There are a few updates to come for this having to do with leap year notification
and possibly a setting to remove the excel compatibility.
